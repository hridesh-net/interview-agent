  "jd": "A Python Developer writes, tests, and maintains efficient, reusable Python code for server-side logic, web applications, data pipelines, or ML models, focusing on backend components, API integration, debugging, performance, and collaboration with frontend teams to build scalable, secure software solutions. Key responsibilities include designing APIs (Django/Flask), integrating services, improving existing systems, and implementing security, often requiring knowledge of databases, ORMs, and front-end basics.  \nCore Responsibilities\nCode Development: Write clean, scalable, and testable Python code for various applications and services. \nBackend Logic: Develop server-side logic, build RESTful APIs, and integrate with external web services and databases (SQL/NoSQL). \nIntegration: Connect front-end elements with server-side logic and integrate third-party applications. \nDebugging & Optimization: Test, debug, and optimize code for performance, security, and scalability. \nCollaboration: Work with product managers, designers, and frontend developers to understand requirements and deliver features. \nData & Automation: Create data processing pipelines, automation scripts, and support data analysis/ML tasks. \nKey Skills & Requirements\nProgramming: Strong expertise in Python, including its core libraries. \nFrameworks: Experience with frameworks like Django, Flask, or Pyramid. \nDatabases: Familiarity with relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases. \nTools: Knowledge of ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) and potentially front-end tech (HTML, JavaScript). \nMethodologies: Understanding of software development methodologies, security best practices, and Agile environments. \nCommon Job Titles\nPython Developer/Programmer/Engineer, Backend Developer, Software Engineer (Python), and Data Engineer (often overlaps).
